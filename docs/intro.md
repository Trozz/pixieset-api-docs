## Overview

Pixieset provides two main APIs that work together to create a complete photography business solution:

### üè¢ Studio API

### üñºÔ∏è Gallery API
The **Gallery API** manages the client-facing delivery and sales platform:
- Photo and video gallery management
- Client access control and sharing
- Download tracking and favorites
- E-commerce integration for print sales

## Quick Start

### Base URLs

```
Studio API: https://studio.pixieset.com/api/v1
Gallery API: https://galleries.pixieset.com/api/v1
```

### Authentication

Both APIs use session-based authentication with cookies. You'll need to:
1. Authenticate with your Pixieset credentials
2. Include session cookies in all API requests
3. Handle session expiration and renewal

### Making Your First Request

Here's a simple example to get started with the Studio API:

```bash
# Get list of clients
curl -X GET "https://studio.pixieset.com/api/v1/clients/" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

## Common Patterns

### Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
Standard HTTP status codes are used:
- `200 OK` - Successful request
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid parameters
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication required
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

### Pagination
Most list endpoints support pagination:
```
GET /endpoint?page=1&per_page=25
```
